As part of my consulting to CiValue (http://www.civalue.com/) I wrote this code.

The models are from:

Ebbage, Alison. "Retail's breadcrumb trail." Engineering & Technology 10.3 (2015): 70-72.

Fader, Peter S., and Bruce GS Hardie. "Modeling the evolution of repeat buying." Available at www-marketing. wharton. upenn. edu/ideas/pdf/98-031. pdf (1999).

Fader, Peter S., Bruce GS Hardie, and Robert Zeithammer. "Forecasting new product trial in a controlled test market environment." Journal of Forecasting 22.5 (2003): 391-410.

Fader, Peter S., Bruce GS Hardie, Robert Zeithammer. Jim Findley "Forecasting new product sales in a controlled test market environment." (2003) *never published
